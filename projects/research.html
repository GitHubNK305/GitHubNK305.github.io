									<h3>Dynamic Modelling and Intelligent Control of Parafoil system
									</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="../images/parafoil.png" alt=""></span>
									
										<p>
											The precise and non-destructive recovery of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will contribute to 
											their recycling, maximizing cost reduction for launches, and ensuring landing area safety. This 
											has significant practical significance and application value. For small and medium-sized 
											fixed-wing UAVs, spacecraft, and launch components (rocket boosters, fairings, etc.) without 
											landing gear, a reusable parafoil recovery system is adopted. By controlling the parafoil's 
											trailing edge downward, adjusting the return trajectory, and performing wind-facing precision 
											landing, precise and non-destructive recovery can be achieved. Therefore, the parafoil recovery 
											system has broad application prospects in military, civilian, aerospace, and other fields.
										</p>
										<p>
											With the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62003175, 61973172) 
											and the National Key Research and Development Program (2019YFC1510900), 
											the applicant comprehensively researched and developed relevant theories and 
											applications of parafoil non-destructive recovery. Aimed at achieving the modeling 
											and precise return of parafoil systems in complex wind and rain environments, 
											a combined approach of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and airdrop 
											experiments was employed. In-depth research was conducted on parafoil system dynamics, 
											return trajectory planning and tracking control, airdrop experiments, and other issues. 
											A preliminary theoretical and applied research system of the parafoil recovery 
											system has been established (see Figure on the left).

									<h3> An intelligent course keeping activedisturbance rejection controller based on double deep Q-network for towing system of unpowered cylindricaldrilling platform

										<p>
											Towing is a widely used mode of transportation in offshore engineering, and towing of unpowered platforms is of particular significance. However, the addition of unpowered facilities has increased the difficulty of ship maneuvering. Moreover, the marine environment is complex and changeable, and sudden winds or waves can have unpredictable effects on the towing process. Therefore, it is of great significance to overcome the influence of the harsh marine environment while navigating the towing system following a planned course to a target sea area. To tackle the time-varying disturbances, a course control method for a towing system of unpowered cylindrical drilling platform is designed based on double deep Q-network (DQN) optimized linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC). To be specific, to tackle the difficulty of LADRC tuning, double DQN is applied to select the best parameters of the LADRC at any time according to the states of the system, without relying on the specific information of the model and the controller. The course control performance of the towing system is evaluated in a simulation environment under various disturbances. Moreover, the Monte Carlo experiment is used to test the robustness of the controller when the ship's mass changes and the robustness of the proposed method is verified by testing with various heading angles. The results show that the LADRC with adaptive parameters optimized by double DQN performs well under external interference and inherent uncertainty, and compared with the traditional LADRC, the proposed method has better course control effects.

									<h3>  A Fall Posture Classification and Recognition Method Based on Wavelet Packet Transform and Support Vector Machine	</h3>

										<p>
											An accidental fall seriously threatens the health and safety of the elderly. The injuries caused by a fall have a lot to do with the different postures during the fall. Therefore, recognizing the posture of falling is essential for the rescue and care of the elderly. In this paper, a novel method was proposed to improve the classification and recognition accuracy of fall postures. Firstly, the wavelet packet transform was used to extract multiple features from sample data. Secondly, random forest was used to evaluate the importance of the extracted features and obtain effective features through screening. Finally, the support vector machine classifier based on the linear kernel function was used to realize the falling posture recognition. The experiment results on “Simulated Falls and Daily Living Activities Data Set” show that the proposed method can distinguish different types of fall postures and achieve 99% classification accuracy.
